# MVP - The Multi View Playground

This repository contains samples to experiment with rendering into multiple
views from Flutter. Some samples are aspirational and may not actually work.
Some samples may require a custom engine build to run. Some samples may be
outdated and/or have other issues. DO NOT DEPEND ON ANYTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY.

To run a sample, execute:

```
$ flutter run -d <windows|linux|macos> -t lib/<sample_file_name>.dart
```
